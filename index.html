      <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
      <h3>Tokyo, the City of Lights</h3>
      <p>
        Tokyo, often referred to as the "City of Lights," stands as a vibrant
        metropolis that seamlessly blends tradition with modernity. As the
        capital of Japan, Tokyo is a sprawling urban landscape characterized by
        its iconic skyline adorned with neon lights that illuminate the
        cityscape, especially in districts like Shibuya and Shinjuku. The
        bustling streets of Tokyo come alive at night, creating a mesmerizing
        spectacle of colorful signs, billboards, and futuristic architecture.
        The city's dynamic energy is palpable as locals and visitors alike
        traverse through a maze of streets lined with an eclectic mix of
        traditional izakayas, contemporary shopping centers, and innovative tech
        hubs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond its dazzling nightlife, Tokyo is a city that pulsates with
        cultural richness. Historic temples and shrines, such as the Meiji
        Shrine and Senso-ji Temple, provide a serene contrast to the high-paced
        urban lifestyle. The city hosts a myriad of museums, showcasing Japan's
        artistic heritage and technological advancements. Tokyo's commitment to
        innovation is evident in its cutting-edge technology districts like
        Akihabara, where electronics stores and gaming centers attract tech
        enthusiasts from around the world. Tokyo, the "City of Lights,"
        encapsulates the essence of a modern global hub while cherishing its
        deep-rooted cultural identity.
